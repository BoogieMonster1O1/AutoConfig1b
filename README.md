# Auto Config API

This is a fork of Auto Config API.

Annotation based API for mod configs, with Cloth Config GUI integration.
For usage instructions, see the [wiki].

## Why is this made?
sargunv, which is the original developer of Auto Config has became inactive, while they still have the intention of updating it, it hasn't happened for a while. This fork will work on 1.14 and 1.15 because cloth config v2 supports both.

## Naming of autoconfig1u
The u stands for updated because I am too lazy to type the whole thing

## Building from source

```bash
https://github.com/shedaniel/AutoConfig.git
cd AutoConfig
./gradlew build
# On Windows, use "gradlew.bat" instead of "gradlew"
```
