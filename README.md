# Auto Config API

This is a fork of Auto Config 1b.

Annotation based API for mod configs ~~with Cloth Config GUI integration~~.

## Why is this made?
~~sargunv, which is the original developer of Auto Config has became inactive, while they still have the intention of updating it, it hasn't happened for a while. This fork will work on 1.14 and 1.15 because cloth config v2 supports both.~~
Because 1.8.9 doesn't have a config api. 

## Naming of autoconfig1u
The b stands for backported because I am too lazy to type the whole thing

## Building from source

```bash
https://github.com/shedaniel/AutoConfig.git
cd AutoConfig
./gradlew build
# On Windows, use ".\gradlew.bar" instead of "./gradlew"
```
